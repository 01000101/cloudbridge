cloudbridge
===========

cloudbridge provides a layer of abstraction over different cloud providers.
It's a straightforward implementation of the `bridge pattern`_. It is currently
under development and is in a Pre-Alpha state.

Usage example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest possible example for doing something useful with cloudbridge would
look like the following.

.. code-block:: python

	from cloudbridge.providers.factory import CloudProviderFactory, ProviderList

	provider = CloudProviderFactory().create_provider(ProviderList.AWS, {})
	print(provider.security.key_pairs.list())

In the example above, the AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY environment variables
must be set to your AWS credentials.

Design Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create a cloud abstraction layer which minimises or eliminates the need for cloud specific special casing (i.e., Not require clients to write ``if EC2 do x else if OPENSTACK do y``.)

2. Have a suite of conformance tests which are comprehensive enough that goal 1 can be achieved. This would also mean that clients need not manually test against each provider to make sure their application is compatible.

3. Opt for a minimum set of features that a cloud provider will support, instead of  a lowest common denominator approach. This means that reasonably mature clouds like Amazon and Openstack are used as the benchmark against which functionality & features are determined. Therefore, there is a definite expectation that the cloud infrastructure will support a compute service with support for images and snapshots and various machine sizes. The cloud infrastructure will very likely support block storage, although this is currently optional. It may optionally support object storage.

4. Make the cloudbridge layer as thin as possible without compromising goal 1. By wrapping the cloud provider's native SDK and doing the minimal work necessary to adapt the interface, we can achieve greater development speed and reliability since the native provider SDK is most likely to have both properties.


Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Community contributions for any part of the project are welcome. If you have
a completely new idea or would like to bounce your idea before moving forward
with the implementation, feel free to create an issue to start a discussion.

Contributions should come in the form or a pull request. We strive for 100%
test coverage so code will only be accepted if it comes with appropriate tests
and it does not break existing functionality. Further, the code needs to be
well documented and all methods have docstrings.

Conceptually, the library is laid out such that there is a factory used to
create a reference to a cloud provider. Each provider offers a set of services
and resources. Services typically perform actions while resources offer
information (and can act on itself, when appropriate). The structure of each
object is defined via an abstract interface (see
``cloudbridge/providers/interfaces``) and any object should implement the
defined interface.

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run the test suite locally, install `tox`_ with :code:`pip install tox`
and run ``tox`` command. This will run all the tests for
all the environments defined in file ``tox.ini``. In order to properly run the
tests, you should have all the environment variables listed in
``tox.ini`` file (under ``passenv``) exported.

If youâ€™d like to run the tests on a specific environment only, use a command
like such: ``tox -e py27`` (or ``python setup.py test`` directly). If you'd
like to run the tests for a specific cloud only, you should export env var
``CB_TEST_PROVIDER`` and specify the desired provider name (e.g., ``aws`` or
``openstack``) and then run the ``tox`` command.

Note that running the tests may create various cloud resources, for which you
may incur costs. For the AWS cloud, there is also a mock provider that will
simulate AWS resources. It is used by default when running the test suite. To
disable it, set the following environment variable:
``export CB_USE_MOCK_DRIVERS=No``.

Testing philosophy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our testing goals are to:

 * Write one set of tests that all provider implementations must pass.
 * Make that set of tests a 'conformance' test suite, which validates that each implementation correctly implements the cloudbridge specification.
 * Make the test suite comprehensive enough that a provider which passes all the tests can be used safely by an application with no additional testing. In other words, the cloudbridge specification and accompanying test suite must be comprehensive enough that no provider specific workarounds, code or testing is required.
 * For development, mock providers may be used to speed up the feedback cycle, but providers must also pass the full suite of tests when run against actual cloud infrastructure to ensure that we are not testing against an idealised or imagined environment.
 * Aim for 100% code coverage.
